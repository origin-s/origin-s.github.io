*北国风光，千里冰封，万里雪飘。
望长城内外，惟余莽莽；
大河上下，顿失滔滔。
山舞银蛇，原驰蜡象，欲与天公试比高。
须晴日，看红装素裹，分外妖娆。
江山如此多娇，引无数英雄竞折腰。
惜秦皇汉武，略输文采；
唐宗宋祖，稍逊风骚。
一代天骄，成吉思汗，只识弯弓射大雕。
俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝。*

***翻译***

*The scenery of the northern country, frozen for thousands of miles and snow drifting for thousands of miles.
Looking inside and outside the Great Wall, only the vastness remains;
The river flows up and down, suddenly losing its surging waves.
Mountain dancing silver snake, originally galloping wax elephant, eager to compete with the Heavenly Lord.
On a sunny day, looking at the red and plain attire, it is particularly enchanting.
There are so many beauties in the mountains and rivers, which have won the hearts of countless heroes.
Cherish the Qin Emperor's martial arts, slightly inferior to literary talent;
Emperor Tang and Emperor Song are somewhat lacking in charm.
A legendary figure, Genghis Khan, only knew how to bow and shoot large eagles.
All are past and gone; we look to this age for truly great men.*
